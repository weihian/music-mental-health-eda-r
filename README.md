Exploratory data analysis of music preferences and listening behavior to understand their relationship with mental health indicators using R.

# Music Preferences and Mental Health Analysis (R)

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between **music preferences, listening behavior, and mental health indicators** using R.  
The analysis is based on a survey dataset (`music.csv`) and investigates how factors such as age, favorite genres, listening duration, and musical engagement relate to mental health conditions including **anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD**.

The project applies **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and correlation analysis**, with both static and interactive visual outputs.
